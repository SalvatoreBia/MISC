# MISC - Data structure collection for C

This is a C library that offers many data structures ready to use! Each of them is designed to accomodate different kinds of data, in order to make them as flexible as possible.

---

The current data structures available are:
- misc_vector
- misc_stack
- misc_queue
- misc_list
- misc_htable
- misc_graph (still working on it)

You can check the documentation on the github pages for this repo.

---

There are a bunch of examples in the `examples` folder, containing a `.c` file that demonstrate a simple usage of the various data structures mentioned above. Running `make` will generate all of the executables for them in the `bin` folder.
